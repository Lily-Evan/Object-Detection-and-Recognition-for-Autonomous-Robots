# Object Detection and Recognition for Autonomous Robots

## Overview

This project implements state-of-the-art computer vision algorithms (YOLO, Faster R-CNN, SSD) for real-time object detection and recognition on a robot's onboard camera. The goal is to enable the robot to identify and avoid obstacles, and recognize specific objects in a warehouse environment — enhancing autonomy and decision-making.

## Features

- Integration of a deep learning-based object detection model with a robotic platform.
- Real-time image processing for reliable obstacle avoidance and object recognition.
- Demonstration of autonomous navigation in a controlled (warehouse-like) environment.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) or [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
- [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/)
- (Optional) [ROS Noetic](http://wiki.ros.org/noetic) for robot integration

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/robot-object-detection.git
cd robot-object-detection
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Model Weights

Download pre-trained weights for YOLO, Faster R-CNN, or SSD and place them in the `models/` directory.

### Running the Demo

```bash
python scripts/run_demo.py --model yolov5 --source 0
```
- `--model`: Choose from `yolov5`, `fasterrcnn`, `ssd`, etc.
- `--source`: Camera index or video file path.

### ROS Integration

If using ROS, run the appropriate launch files and nodes for image acquisition and robot control in the `robot/` directory.

## Expected Outcomes

- **Real-time object detection** using onboard camera streams.
- **Autonomous navigation** with obstacle avoidance and object recognition.
- **Demo video** of the system navigating a mock warehouse.
